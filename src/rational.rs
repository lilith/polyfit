//! Rational polynomial fitting: P(x)/Q(x) approximation.
//!
//! Fits a rational polynomial P(x)/Q(x) to data or a known function using
//! iteratively reweighted least squares (Sanathanan-Koerner iteration).
//!
//! Unlike standard polynomial fitting (which is a linear problem), rational
//! fitting is inherently nonlinear because the denominator coefficients appear
//! in the divisor. The Sanathanan-Koerner algorithm linearizes this by
//! iteratively reweighting residuals, converging to the true least-squares
//! solution.
//!
//! # Use cases
//!
//! Rational polynomials are particularly good at approximating:
//! - Transfer functions (sRGB, PQ, HLG)
//! - Transcendental functions (log₂, exp₂, powf)
//! - Functions with steep gradients or asymptotic behavior
//! - Any function where a standard polynomial needs high degree but P/Q needs low degree
//!
//! # Coefficient convention
//!
//! Coefficients are stored **lowest-degree-first** (Horner order):
//! ```text
//! P(x) = p[0] + p[1]*x + p[2]*x² + ... + p[m]*x^m
//! Q(x) = q[0] + q[1]*x + q[2]*x² + ... + x^n     (monic: leading coeff = 1)
//! ```
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```rust
//! use polyfit::rational::{RationalFit, RationalFitOptions};
//!
//! // Approximate x^2.4 on [0.04, 1.0] with a 4/4 rational polynomial
//! let fit = RationalFit::from_function(
//!     |x: f64| x.powf(2.4),
//!     0.04..=1.0,
//!     4, 4,
//!     RationalFitOptions::default(),
//! ).unwrap();
//!
//! // Evaluate
//! let y = fit.y(0.5);
//! assert!((y - 0.5_f64.powf(2.4)).abs() < 1e-6);
//!
//! // Get coefficients for use in Horner evaluation
//! let (p, q) = fit.coefficients();
//! println!("P: {:?}", p);
//! println!("Q: {:?}", q);
//! ```
//!
//! # Determinism
//!
//! The full pipeline is deterministic: identical input produces identical output.
//! Sample nodes are Chebyshev-spaced (no RNG), SK/LM iterations are fully
//! numerical, multi-restart perturbations use `sin`/`cos` of fixed-constant
//! phases (no RNG), and f32 local search is a deterministic coordinate descent.
//! No `rand` dependency, no hidden seeds. Coefficient changes must come from
//! changing the *inputs* (degree, domain, restart count, weight), never the
//! wall clock.
//!
//! # Measurement honesty
//!
//! [`F32SearchResult`] records `exhaustive: bool` and `values_scored: u64` so
//! callers can tell whether reported metrics come from a full f32 sweep or
//! from uniform sampling. [`piecewise_gap`] measures the ULP gap between a
//! linear segment and the rational polynomial at their join — different from
//! the reference-vs-polynomial ULP at the boundary. [`measure_roundtrip`]
//! measures `f⁻¹(f(v))` error including `u8` and `u16` step counts for
//! regression gating.
